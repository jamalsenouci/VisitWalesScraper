Following Sustrans Route 82 and then the Mawddach Trail, the Greenway follows an historic route linking North Wales to Dolgellau and the coastal resort of Barmouth.The section south of Trawsfynydd follows the old turnpike road to Dolgellau, and the eagle-eyed will spot one or two of the old milestones along the way.However, this old road dips in and out of an even older Roman road, Sarn Helen, coming south from the Tomen y Mur fort near the start of the route. Beyond Dolgellau, the Greenway follows the route of the old railway line, the Mawddach Trail to the coast, finishing across the iconic Barmouth Viaduct.The area is rich with historical sites, from the ancient Roman fort, through 18th and 19th century railways, copper smelting works and gold mines, to the relatively modern Second World War fortifications close to the coast.Those seeking adventure will also not be disappointed, as the route links two of the Eryri Centres of Excellence for adventure tourism at Llyn Trawsfynydd and Coed y Brenin. With the chance to try your hand at kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, high-ropes, orienteering and geocaching at these sites, there is plenty to do.For a hardy few, the Greenway might also make a running challenge; from the start to crossing the railway line in Barmouth is almost exactly a marathon length. To complete the experience, Visitor Centres at both Centres of Excellence offer good quality food and drink, along with plenty of choices for refreshments in Dolgellau and Barmouth.Section 1: 15km section of Greenway between Llyn Trawsfynydd and Coed y BreninSection 2: 12km section of Greenway between Coed y Brenin and DolgellauSection 3: 15km section of Greenway between Dolgellau and Barmouth","49":"Based in the heart of prime mountain biking territory, Bikefax aims to put together the best maps and information on mountain biking available. We started things off with a guide to Snowdonia, then we thought North East Wales deserved a guidebook too. Before we knew it we were packing ourselves off to the Alps and writing a guide to Morzine & Portes du Soleil.Then we went up north, to write 'Southern Scotland & the 7stanes, and most lately off to Spain for our very latest edition to the Bikefax factory, 'Mountain Bike Southern Spain'. No rest for the wicked, eh? As are so many good ideas, Bikefax was born on a rainy day in a caf\u00e9 in North Wales. Berating the lack of quality information for mountain bikers in the UK, Sue bravely took on the task of writing a guide for her home patch of North Wales. Before long insanity had overtaken all of us and we had committed ourselves to setting up a company to provide clear dedicated trail information for the whole of the UK and abroad.","50":"Guides have National Governing Body qualifications issued through the Scottish Mountain Bike Leaders Association (SMBLA) part of British Cycling, the body responsible for cycle sports in the UK.

As such it is the perfect venue for novice and expert mountain bikers alike.

It is part of Organig Parc, a working organic farm and 5-star, eco-friendly, holiday cottage complex, and is stocked with rainbow trout.

It has a good head of wild brown trout which is added to by a small stocking each year, but these fish quickly adapt to their new home. The glacial lake is fed by clear mountain water from the nearby heights.The brown trout season starts in April, and fishing from boat or bank is available. High water will be present at this time of year, but in a lake which has an average depth of only 8ft floating lines can be used from the outset. September will see the main run of sea trout and salmon into the river and as these runs have improved in numbers in recent years, good sport can be anticipated. The lake will have Daddies, Sedges and Heather flies about to keep the sea angler very busy.If you visit at the end of the lake's fishing season - mid October - you will find that many sea trout and salmon are inhabiting the lake making flyfishing very interesting indeed. These migratory fish lie at the mouths of the streams which run into the lake on the Northern shore and can add excitement if you hook a salmon or sea trout on brown trout tackle.The fishing is controlled at the Tynycornel Hotel at the lake side, and not only will you be able to fish Tal-y-Llyn itself but you will also have a wide variety of flyfishing on your doorstep. The hotel has all the facilities an angler could wish for such as drying room, rod rooms and freezer plus excellent rooms and great menus.If you like the wilds of the moors, the hotel also manages the fishing on Llyn Bugeilyn, about ten miles away above Machynlleth, and high up at 1800ft where it offers truly wild brown trout flyfishing where small black and Peacock spiders often work well. It can be fished from a drifting boat or from sections of the bank.Alternatively, if you like river fishing, a beat on the Dysynni can be booked. At the right time of year sea trout and salmon run right up the river to Tal-y-Llyn. Finally, go to the estuary where you may encounter bass which, taken on a fly, are tremendous fighters. This variety of fishing is what makes the area so special.Tynycornel Hotel is managed by Tom Rowlands, an avid and enthusiastic angler.As well as all this choice of fishing, Tom is keen to promote float tubing and has tubes for hire on Tal-y-Llyn and Bugeilyn. His particular love is flyfishing for bass at the Dysinni estuary, white frog nobblers being one of the flies which work well in this area.Tom even uses his float tube, in calm conditions, to fish slightly further into the channel which runs offshore from this small estuary. Mullet are encountered in the Broadwater Lagoon very close to the estuary, and in the right conditions can be taken on a fly, again something small and black such as a Williams' Favourite.So if you feel the need for freedom in a wild setting, or fancy new flyfishing challenges, Tal-y-Llyn is an excellent bet.","57":"Many of our regular fishermen insist that we are North Wales Premier Fishery.All our lakes have purpose built fishing pegs with paths leading to all fishing pegs.

Light refreshments are available from the shop and for something more substantial from the Dutch Pancake House and Restaurant serving delicious large sweet & savoury pancakes & a choice of specials from 11am.The hardest choice you will have to make is which lake to fish first. The 18 peg Cannel Lake is approximately 5-6ft deep with an island down its centre ideal for pole fishing or the newcomer to the sport. It is stocked with mixed Carp, Bream, tench, Barbel & Orfe all up to 4lb in weight. The Middle Specimen Lake was stocked over 15 years ago so the fish have had plenty of time to grow. It is 2 acres in size & is up to 10ft deep which makes it ideal for all year round fishing. The lake is stocked with 24lb+ carp, Ghosties, Crucians, Mirrors, Bream, Tench, Orfe, Barbel, Chub, Roach & Rudd so there is something for everyones taste.The Bottom Scenic Lake is situated in a small valley surrounded by trees which makes it a beautiful place to spend a summer\u2019s day fishing.

But as our sport has grown and sites become more crowded,inevitably issues have occurred and so the need for the clubs existence has became moreand more important.Hang gliding and paragliding are very visual sports. We and many others love to seepilots free flying around the hills but, to landowners and farmers, we can sometimes beseen as an increasing problem and even a threat to their livelihoods. All our sites are in atraditional hill farming area and livestock is almost always present whenever we fly.Conflict between landowners and the free flying community can easily occur in thesesensitive areas, and sites can be lost through one unfortunate incident.SSS now manages the flying sites on and around the Snowdon massif and, in agreementwith the National Park, National Trust and the other private landowners, it is therecognised representative body for hang gliding and paragliding in the area. Our sitesare registered with the BHPA, but site sovereignty goes nowhere without the consent ofthe landowners themselves. SSS works hard to keep communication and relationshipsopen and positive with the local landowners but this relies heavily on the attitude of thepilots on the hill.Understanding the negotiated agreements for flying in this area is key to the continuedfreedom we have in these hills. SSS has produced a guide to all the major flying sites inthis area, detailing the parking and launching agreements and any local restrictionsarranged with the landowners - your possession of this information in everyone'sinterest.Your membership to SSS helps pay for the production of these sites guides andnewsletters and goes towards helping us maintain good open relationships with thelandowners, with the limited resources we have.Northern Snowdonia is an incredible place to fly and with everyone's help it can remainan open and friendly area to fly.
