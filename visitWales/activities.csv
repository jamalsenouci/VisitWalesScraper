It has a good head of wild brown trout which is added to by a small stocking each year, but these fish quickly adapt to their new home. The glacial lake is fed by clear mountain water from the nearby heights.The brown trout season starts in April, and fishing from boat or bank is available. High water will be present at this time of year, but in a lake which has an average depth of only 8ft floating lines can be used from the outset. September will see the main run of sea trout and salmon into the river and as these runs have improved in numbers in recent years, good sport can be anticipated. The lake will have Daddies, Sedges and Heather flies about to keep the sea angler very busy.If you visit at the end of the lake's fishing season - mid October - you will find that many sea trout and salmon are inhabiting the lake making flyfishing very interesting indeed. These migratory fish lie at the mouths of the streams which run into the lake on the Northern shore and can add excitement if you hook a salmon or sea trout on brown trout tackle.The fishing is controlled at the Tynycornel Hotel at the lake side, and not only will you be able to fish Tal-y-Llyn itself but you will also have a wide variety of flyfishing on your doorstep. The hotel has all the facilities an angler could wish for such as drying room, rod rooms and freezer plus excellent rooms and great menus.If you like the wilds of the moors, the hotel also manages the fishing on Llyn Bugeilyn, about ten miles away above Machynlleth, and high up at 1800ft where it offers truly wild brown trout flyfishing where small black and Peacock spiders often work well. It can be fished from a drifting boat or from sections of the bank.Alternatively, if you like river fishing, a beat on the Dysynni can be booked. At the right time of year sea trout and salmon run right up the river to Tal-y-Llyn. Finally, go to the estuary where you may encounter bass which, taken on a fly, are tremendous fighters. This variety of fishing is what makes the area so special.Tynycornel Hotel is managed by Tom Rowlands, an avid and enthusiastic angler.As well as all this choice of fishing, Tom is keen to promote float tubing and has tubes for hire on Tal-y-Llyn and Bugeilyn. His particular love is flyfishing for bass at the Dysinni estuary, white frog nobblers being one of the flies which work well in this area.Tom even uses his float tube, in calm conditions, to fish slightly further into the channel which runs offshore from this small estuary. Mullet are encountered in the Broadwater Lagoon very close to the estuary, and in the right conditions can be taken on a fly, again something small and black such as a Williams' Favourite.So if you feel the need for freedom in a wild setting, or fancy new flyfishing challenges, Tal-y-Llyn is an excellent bet.",Tal-y-Llyn Lake,,+44 01654 78228,Fishing,4,52.6801507,-3.8882915

On the Friday night, once everybody had arrived - we will sit down and figure out what YOU want to do. Obviously, it's a democratic process, and we cannot please everybody all of the time, but we aim to show you a good variety of the exceptional swims that we have to offer in North Wales.So depending on the groups wishes;- we could be going for long distance swims along beaches or around headlands,- we could be doing adventrous dips and exploring some of the nooks and crannies of the craggy Welsh coastline (probably not all 750 miles of it though)- we could be enjoying the sunshine (yes it does happen in Wales) on sandy beach and playing in the surf- we could be cruising down a river, going with the flow and seeing the world from a different angle, at a different pace- we could be scaling mountains to dip into hidden lakes, or bathe under mountain waterfallsor far more likely, we will be doing a combination of all of them.Wild swimming in Wales does not get much betterThe swims will be tailored to YOUR capabilities, and there is absolutely no pressure for people to be swimming laps of Anglesey. Each swim will be as long or as short as YOU want it to be. We always make sure that we have options at many of the venues we go to.It is a cliche these days, but safety is our number one priority. Dan has spent over a decade of his life working in the area of water safety, and there is simply no way that he will compromise on that. If the Gone Swimming team does not feel that it is safe to take you to a swim, then we will take you somewhere else.This is the huge advantage of having local guides, with local knowledge, and no fixed itinerary or journey to swim. If the wind is howling from one direction, we will be sure to know of some sheltered spots where we can still have a nice swim.
